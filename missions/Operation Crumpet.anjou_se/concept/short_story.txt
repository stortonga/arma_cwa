The morning's southeasterly breeze had rapidly picked up and grown into a full thunderstorm. After hours of torrential downpour on this 17th of May, 1944, USAF Major Tim Armstrong, a C-47 captain and avid gardener back home in the States was convinced that someone must have had pissed off the ice saints for good. This very morning, Armstrong and his FO Captain Brendon Miller had enjoyed landing their C-47 in perfect weather. From there, the day had gone pretty much downhill for RAF Darlington, the weather rendering all flight ops suspended until further notice.
